North Style Prototype
=====================
This is a Style Prototype generated by the [North Style Prototype Generator](https://github.com/north/generator-Style-Prototype).

It's a generic Style Prototype, so that you can start editing and working on it right away for your projects.

In case you're having problems with the the generation of your Style Prototype, feel free to clone this instead.

Installation & Configuration
============================
Make sure to `bower install` and `npm install` to install all the Style Prototype components.

Once it's done, use `gulp` to start up the server.

More instructions can be seen at the [North Style Prototype Generator](https://github.com/north/generator-Style-Prototype) page.

Known Issues
============
As of now, both the generator and the style prototypes might be breaking when ran on Node 0.11+ as a result of execSync not compiling the extensions correctly (since it's been deprecated in 0.11). As of know, I'm still not sure of how to fix it, I'll try to update this section when I get more information on how to troubleshoot it.
